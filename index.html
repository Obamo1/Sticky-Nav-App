    <p>“In Greece, after just moving there, couldn’t find my house, w/ no phone + only knowing 2 Greek words. Best part of #gettinglost – it was sunset, view was beautiful, and it was an opportunity to meet new people who could help me!” -- Jennie Armstrong</p>

    <p>“Getting lost driving through the Wicklow Mountains of Ireland in August was heavenly - lonely – all blue skies, wildflowers, the road behind hidden by the curves, so it looked like nothing man-made was around us… and other parts just looked like we were on the moon.” -- Jordyn Paige Thomson</p>

    <p>“In Pichilemu, Chile, a beach town about 4 hours outside the capital: It was Independence Day and a friend and I went right from the room we were renting to a city-wide BBQ. On our way back, we realized we didn’t know the address, street name, or have a phone number of the woman we rented the room from. We spent 3 hours roaming the streets near the bus station, looking for familiar colorings on houses. Finally, we asked for help by a few local teenagers out celebrating, who escorted us through the city plaza, down the last few streets we hadn’t searched, to finally find the house!” -- Catherine Kittycat</p>

    <p>“I was in Istanbul and we went to a restaurant that was on the peak of a hill. When we came down, we got lost and ended up walking thru a graveyard. The entire hill was a graveyard and we had to climb some fences and all. Never forget that one for sure!” -- Nina Vaughn-Mueller</p>
